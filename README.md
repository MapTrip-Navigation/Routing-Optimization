# How To Optimize And Navigate 200 Stops

A customer had 200 stops which he needs to visit in one tour. Here is what we suggested to meet the challenge. First, the stops need to be put in the optimal order to minimize drive time and distance. Then a FollowMe navigation file is created which contains an event at each location. This can then be uploaded to the FollowMe Editor and synchronized with MapTrip for navigation

## Preparations

This is what you need to do to use our MapAPI:

The easiest way is to include the core.js, which contains the mapping parts themself, base classes and interfaces.

just insert this

into your page and start using the API. This will load the core API, the modules vectortiles , graphics , routing and controls.
