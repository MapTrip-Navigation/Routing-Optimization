# How To Optimize And Navigate 200 Stops

A customer had 200 stops which he needs to visit in one tour. Here is what we suggested to meet the challenge. First, the stops need to be put in the optimal order to minimize drive time and distance. Then a FollowMe navigation file is created which contains an event at each location. This can then be uploaded to the FollowMe Editor and synchronized with MapTrip for navigation
